Usage
=====

There are two main reactors to choose from, Tokamak and Spherical Tokamak.
These can be built with:
- A radial and vertical build
- A radial build and plasma elongation.

The former gives the user more control of the size of components allowing reactor blankets to vary both radially and vertically.
The later allows reactors to be built with a minimal number of parameters.
In all cases it is possible to add additional components such as divertors, poloidal and toroidal magnets and any self made geometry as a CadQuery Workplane.
The reactors can be varied in terms of their radial build, vertical build, elongation and triangularity which gives a lot of variability.
These examples show how to make various reactors with and without different components, each example is minimal and aims to show a single feature, you will have to combine examples to make a complete model.
